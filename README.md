**Introduction:**

MHelper is a campus-side social community that promotes the intelligence exchange and collaboration among UM people with diverse backgrounds. It serves as an online platform for any UM people to seek for help on their tasks or provide help with their skills and knowledge. Although it is an online social community, MHelper highly values offline interaction among people to work on tasks together and develop real-life social network.

MHelper is unique to provide a wide range of specialties, hence a wide range of tasks and skills. Therefore, Helpees can easily get access to the skillsets needed for their tasks, while Helpers can easily find tasks fit for their skillsets and interests. To give credit for Helpersâ€™ effort, their skills and performance will be presented in their profile as proof of competence.
